// tsconfig.json for eslint
//
// Because the typescript-eslint plugin does not receive information from eslint about the overall
// set of files to be linted, it's forced to hold all TypeScript projects in memory at once. Since
// our monorepo contains several separate projects, we run into memory limits when running eslint on
// all the projects in a single run.
//
// Making eslint use just a single tsconfig means it doesn't need to hold as much in memory. This
// works as long as our packages' tsconfigs don't vary much beyond the base config.
//
// Another alternative would be to run eslint separately on each project's files. This would be a
// bit trickier to maintain since it requires a script to make multiple eslint runs, and possibly a
// separate eslintrc file for each project to point it at the appropriate tsconfig (although it's
// not clear this part is necessary).
//
