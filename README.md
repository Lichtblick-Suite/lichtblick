**Dependencies:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.10+
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

<hr/>

## :rocket: Getting started

Clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bmw-software-engineering/lichtblick.git
```

Pull large files with Git LFS:

```sh
$ git lfs pull
```

Enable corepack:

```sh
$ corepack enable
```

Install packages from `package.json`:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

- If you still get errors about corepack after running `corepack enable`, try uninstalling and reinstalling Node.js. Ensure that Yarn is not separately installed from another source, but is installed _via_ corepack.

Launch the development environment:

```sh
# To launch the desktop app (run both scripts concurrently):
$ yarn desktop:serve        # start webpack
$ yarn desktop:start        # launch electron

# To launch the web app:
$ yarn run web:serve        # it will be avaiable in http://localhost:8080
```

## :hammer_and_wrench: Building Lichtblick

Build the application for production using these commands:

```sh
# To build the desktop apps:
$ yarn run desktop:build:prod   # compile necessary files

- yarn run package:win         # Package for windows
- yarn run package:darwin      # Package for macOS
- yarn run package:linux       # Package for linux

# To build the web app:
$ yarn run web:build:prod

# To build and run the web app using docker:
$ docker build . -t lichtblick
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 lichtblick

# It is possible to clean up build files using the following command:
$ yarn run clean
```

- The desktop builds are located in the `dist` directory, and the web builds are found in the `web/.webpack` directory.
