// datasets (many hundred thousand) messages, preloading the data (i.e. to plot a signal) would
// result in several hundred thousand RPC calls. The overhead of making these calls add up and
// negatively impact the preloading experience.
//
// Providing an interface which allows callers to read a batch of messages significantly (4x speedup
// on an 700k message dataset on M1 Pro) reduces the RPC call overhead.
