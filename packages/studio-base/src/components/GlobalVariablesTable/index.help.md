# Variables

Variables are values that can be set globally for a given layout. They’re prefixed with a `$` for easy reference, and can be set to any valid string, number, or boolean value.

You can use variables in any panel that supports message path syntax to help you switch quickly between subsets of your data. Certain panels like the 3D and Variable Slider panels can update variable values with user interactions.
