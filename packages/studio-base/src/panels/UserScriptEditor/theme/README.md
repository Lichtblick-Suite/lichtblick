# MonacoEditor Themes

If you want to tweak an existing theme, go to this [url](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Monokai), and upload the `.thmTheme` file.

From there, you will be able to apply various colors. After you're done editing the theme, use https://bitwiser.in/monaco-themes/ to turn it into javascript:

1. Download the `.tmTheme` file.
2. Overwrite the existing `.tmTheme` file.
3. Go to this [site](https://bitwiser.in/monaco-themes/) and upload the `.tmFile`. It will convert it into the vs-code json definition of a theme.
4. Save this to a new .ts file.
