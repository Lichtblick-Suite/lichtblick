# Diagnostics - Summary

Display the status of your nodes from topics with a [`diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray`](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/diagnostic_msgs/html/msg/DiagnosticArray.html) or [`diagnostic_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray`](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/diagnostic_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray.msg) datatype.

You can pin a node to the top of your feed, filter entries by `hardware_id` and node, or sort nodes by level. You can also click any entry to see its details in the `Diagnostics – Detail` panel.
