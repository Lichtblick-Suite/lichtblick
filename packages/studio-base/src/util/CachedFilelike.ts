// CachedFilelike is a `Filelike` that attempts to do as much caching of the file in memory as
// possible. It takes in 3 named arguments to its constructor:
// - fileReader: a `FileReader` instance (defined below). This essentially does the streamed
//     fetching of ranges from our file.
// - cacheSizeInBytes (optional): how many bytes we're allowed to cache. Defaults to infinite
//     caching (meaning that the cache will be as big as the file size). `cacheSizeInBytes` also
//     becomes the largest range of data that can be requested.
// - logFn (optional): a log function. Useful for logging in a particular format. Defaults to
//     `console.log`.
// - keepReconnectingCallback (optional): if set, we assume that we want to keep retrying on connection
//     error, in which case the callback gets called with an update on whether we are currently
//     reconnecting. This is useful when the connection is expected to be spotty, e.g. when
//     running this code in a browser instead of on a server. If omitted, we will retry for a short
//     amount of time and then reject read requests.
//
// Under the hood this uses a `VirtualLRUBuffer`, which represents the entire file in memory, even
// though only parts of it may actually be stored in memory. It also manages evicting least recently
// used blocks from memory.
//
// We keep a list of byte ranges that have been requested, and their associated callbacks. Typically
// there will be only one such requested range at the time, as usually we need to parse some data
// first before we can read more. We keep one stream from the `fileReader` open at a time, and we
// serve the requested byte ranges in order.
//
// If there are currently no requested byte ranges, we try to intelligently load as much data as
// possible into memory, with a preference given to ranges immediately following the last requested
// byte range. If the cache spans the entire file size, we try to download the entire file.
