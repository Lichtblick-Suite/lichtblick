/**
 * Wraps an instantiated `Worker` and exposes its API in the same way that `Comlink.wrap` does
 * but it also provides a `dispose` function to terminate the worker and release the comlink proxy.
 * This can help prevent memory leaks when the comlink proxy is unable to garbage collect itself due to
 * unresolved promises which can occur if the worker is terminated while processing a request.
 * This should be used instead of `Comlink.wrap` where possible.
 *
 * @param worker - worker to be wrapped by comlink
 * @returns remote - API for worker wrapped by comlink. What is normally received from Comlink.wrap
 * @returns dispose - function to release the comlink proxy and to terminate the worker
