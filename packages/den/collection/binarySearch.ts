/**
 * Performs a binary search on a sorted array of tuples to find the index of the entry with the given key.
 *
 * Copied from @lichtblick/den/collection ArrayMap
 *
 * @param key Key to search for.
 * @returns The index of the key/value tuple if an exact match is found; otherwise, a negative
 * number. If the key is not found and the key is less than one or more keys in the list, the
 * negative number returned is the bitwise complement of the index of the first element with a
 * larger key. If the key is not found and is greater than all keys in the list, the negative
 * number returned is the bitwise complement of the index of the last element plus 1.
