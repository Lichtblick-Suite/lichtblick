# sensor_msgs/NavSatFix
# Navigation Satellite fix for any Global Navigation Satellite System
#
# Specified using the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid

# header.stamp specifies the ROS time for this measurement (the
#        corresponding satellite time may be reported using the
#        sensor_msgs/TimeReference message).
#
# header.frame_id is the frame of reference reported by the satellite
#        receiver, usually the location of the antenna.  This is a
#        Euclidean frame relative to the vehicle, not a reference
#        ellipsoid.
